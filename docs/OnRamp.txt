OnRamp Meetings
===============


Would be good to have projector & whiteboard 

- At each OnRamp, have (at least) one person bring up their code and explain a problem they're having
- Get the 'brains trust' to suggest changes and make comments. 
- Can use the whiteboard to sketch out ideas / concepts


Why? 

- Two types of ppl in these communities
	- spectators (reddit: lurkers)
	- active participants

- Both are 100% valid.
	- Spectators are often newer members who lack confidence or think their skills aren't as good
	- Active participants are more seasoned members who want to share their knowledge and nut out a problem

- OnRamp could fit the 'masterclass' model
	- Spectators get a masterclass where they can watch the process. Entertaining and educational
	- Active participants get the chance to apply expertise and teach

- Over time, some spectators will start to get involved as active participants! 


This ticks another box which is lacking: mentorship

- Industry: larger software teams. 
    - Code review 
    - mentoring by more senior devs
    - community which you can ask for help

- Academia: Small software teams (or working alone). 
    - None of the above. 
    - Mostly use free online resources (youtube, stackoverflow) for eductation


OnRamp could foster a culture of code review, and a community where devs can connect within parkville precint


not all OnRampers are software engineers
