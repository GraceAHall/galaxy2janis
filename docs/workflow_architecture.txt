A 'step' can contain a tool or workflow (as workflows are tools too)
Workflow cannot therefore be singleton


believe it may be possible to register each entity and only reference via uuid

process {
    inputs      []
    operations  []
    outputs     []
}

workflow --------
inputs:  [uuid, uuid, uuid]
steps:   [uuid, uuid, uuid, uuid]
outputs: [uuid]

step --------
inputs:             [uuid, uuid]
tool/subworkflow:   uuid
outputs:            [uuid, uuid]
