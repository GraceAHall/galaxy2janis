TOOL PARSING

Minor (mostly formatting and cleanliness)
- samtools_idxstats ew
    ToolInput(
		'input_@_file',
		File,
		prefix='-@',
		position=1,
		default="$addthreads",
		doc="None",
	),
- 'File' type or 'String' type should be default? what about ENV_VARS?
- tag formatting [not bug]: u_int1 (-u) / u_int2 (-U) (cutadapt)
- tag formatting [not bug]: out_out11, out_out12, out_out21, out_out22
- paths with quotes (fastqc)
    cp '/tmp/tmppzuicyfk/working/dataset_28_files'/*/fastqc_data.txt output.txt

Intermediate (has an impact on number of inputs/outputs, may break tool in some way)
- challenging <command> text at start of main tool statement (nanoplot)
    $reads_temp.append("read_" + str($i) + "." + str($extension))
    potential solution 1 - if evaluated tests, these will start with correct word 
    potential solution 2 - ignore any words before first RAW_STRING?
- 'argument' attribute written incorrectly - causes 2 inputs
    see quast references_list1, references_list2
    maybe could check if the prefix is in the command? 
    could also ensure argument starts with '--', then check again? 
- multiple prefixes for option (hisat2)
    ToolInput(
		'trim51',
		Int(optional=True),
		prefix='-5',
		position=2,
		default=0,
		doc="Trim 5' end. Trim N bases from 5' (left) end of each read before alignment, default: 0",
	),
    ToolInput(
		'trim52',
		Int(optional=True),
		prefix='--trim5',
		position=2,
		default=0,
		doc="Trim 5' end. Trim N bases from 5' (left) end of each read before alignment, default: 0",
	)
- WildcardSelector for outputs, but XML also references $output in <command> (cutadapt)
    ToolOutput(
		'out_out11',
		Array(FastqSanger),
		selector=InputSelector("output_fastqsanger"),
		doc="Read 1 Output",
	),
    ToolOutput(
		'out_out12',
		Array(FastqSanger),
		selector=WildcardSelector("out1*"),
		doc="Read 1 Output",
	)


Major (program execution fails, tool definitely non-functional)
- Kraken2Tax

- should create a file containing tricky text, and ensure that the text
  is being assigned correct tokens
- featurecounts.xml tool cannot load itself into galaxy representation
    <options from_data_table="featurecounts_anno">
        <filter type="data_meta" key="dbkey" ref="alignment" column="dbkey"/>
    </options>
    I believe this is a parsing issue, rather than needing to get galaxy server db info. 
    Not sure how to fix.
    see the following files in the featurecounts XML dir: 
        - tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample
        - tool_data_table_conf.xml.test
        - tool-data/featurecounts_anno.loc.sample
        - tool-data/gene_sets.loc.sample



WORKLFOW PARSING

Minor (mostly formatting and cleanliness)

intermediate (has an impact on number of inputs/outputs, may break workflow in some way)
- conditional params (simple_workflow.ga step)
    unicycler(
        l_file=w.unicycler_l_file,
        fastq_input1=w.in_forward_reads,
        fastq_input2=w.in_reverse_reads,
        s_fastqsanger=w.in_forward_reads,  
        pilon_path=w.unicycler_pilon_path,
        long=w.in_long_reads,
        start_genes=w.unicycler_start_genes,
        contamination=w.unicycler_contamination,
    )
    fastq_input1 / s_fastqsanger are governed by galaxy XML conditional case. 
    w.in_forward_reads can be wired to either depending on that case. 
    currently not evaluating the state of the case.

Major (program execution fails)
