Before MVP
Definite
- basic array handling (single item)
- top 20 most common galaxy tools parsed correctly
- three workflows parsed, can be translated by janis to wdl/cwl
- logging: mark areas for user to complete / provide messages

Maybe
- janis tool test parsing and evaluation functions (from xml to janis definition)
- arrays properly
