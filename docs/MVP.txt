conditional params (simple_workflow.ga step)
    unicycler(
        l_file=w.unicycler_l_file,
        fastq_input1=w.in_forward_reads,
        fastq_input2=w.in_reverse_reads,
        s_fastqsanger=w.in_forward_reads,  
        pilon_path=w.unicycler_pilon_path,
        long=w.in_long_reads,
        start_genes=w.unicycler_start_genes,
        contamination=w.unicycler_contamination,
    )
    fastq_input1 / s_fastqsanger are governed by galaxy XML conditional case. 
    w.in_forward_reads can be wired to either depending on that case. 
    currently not evaluating the state of the case.
