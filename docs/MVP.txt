TOOL PARSING

Minor
- 'File' type or 'String' type should be default? what about ENV_VARS?
- tag formatting [not bug]: u_int1 (-u) / u_int2 (-U) (cutadapt)
- tag formatting [not bug]: out_out11, out_out12, out_out21, out_out22
- paths with quotes (fastqc)
    cp '/tmp/tmppzuicyfk/working/dataset_28_files'/*/fastqc_data.txt output.txt


Major
- should create a file containing tricky text, and ensure that the text
  is being assigned correct tokens
- featurecounts tool cannot load itself into galaxy representation
    <options from_data_table="featurecounts_anno">
        <filter type="data_meta" key="dbkey" ref="alignment" column="dbkey"/>
    </options>
    I believe this is a parsing issue, rather than needing to get galaxy server db info. 
    Not sure how to fix.
    see the following files in the featurecounts XML dir: 
        - tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample
        - tool_data_table_conf.xml.test
        - tool-data/featurecounts_anno.loc.sample
        - tool-data/gene_sets.loc.sample



WORKLFOW PARSING

- conditional params (simple_workflow.ga step)
    unicycler(
        l_file=w.unicycler_l_file,
        fastq_input1=w.in_forward_reads,
        fastq_input2=w.in_reverse_reads,
        s_fastqsanger=w.in_forward_reads,  
        pilon_path=w.unicycler_pilon_path,
        long=w.in_long_reads,
        start_genes=w.unicycler_start_genes,
        contamination=w.unicycler_contamination,
    )
    fastq_input1 / s_fastqsanger are governed by galaxy XML conditional case. 
    w.in_forward_reads can be wired to either depending on that case. 
    currently not evaluating the state of the case.
