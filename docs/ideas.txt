env variables #set by cheetah
 - rewrite the XML <command> section with echo '\$varname' '$varname' everytime we can set a cheetah variable
 - that way, whenever a cheetah env var is set, the varname and its realised value are printed
 - can use this for the input mapping to command line for workflow parsing

 - make string representation of TTestCases so we can actually write to a janis tool def file


Galaxy types
    - composite types like imzML? is there info on secondary type? 
    - that kind of extra data can be found in the actual type class def. needed?  

non-wildcard Outputs
    - currently just keeping as WilcardSelector. Not sure how glob works and is deprecated. 
    - glob="output.fastq" works when path is directly known
    - stringformatter for paths ie concatenating folder and filename

Helptext
    - restructuredText processing to make helptext nicer


Future -------------------------------------------
    
 - workflowstep command loading
    - '__class__': 'ConnectedValue' - do traceback to original dataset
    - '__class__': 'RuntimeValue' - write warning to user stating the value needs to be set on the run

 - paired files & collections (short reads, composite types imzml)
 - new tools added to toolshed automatically parsed 
 - any which do not pass tests can have manual intervention (fornight / monthly activity)
 - start galaxy workflow parser -> janis
