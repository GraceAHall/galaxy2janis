    this was actually a broken tool.

    if_nr==1_{print="{if (NR==1) {print}}"
    cooked


TODO

issue
    hisat2
    wrong dynamiccommandstring being chosen as main tool statement


issue
    hisat2
    Long and short form for argument (hisat2)
    ToolInput('trim51', Int(optional=True), prefix='-5')
    ToolInput('trim52', Int(optional=True), prefix='--trim5')
solution?
    Single galaxy parameter can only be linked to single tool input? no?
    Prefer ‘--’ longform in these cases

issue
    cutadapt
    WildcardSelector outputs which also have direct <command> reference 
    WildcardSelector for outputs, but XML also references $output in <command> (cutadapt)
    ToolOutput('out_out11', selector=InputSelector("output_fastqsanger"))
    ToolOutput('out_out12', selector=WildcardSelector("out1*"))
solution?
    When creating Output CommandComponents, check if a referenced gxparam is available, and if it has a collection method (from_work_dir, discover_datatsets etc), don’t add this as an Output. It will be picked up at the end anyway and will be formatted using the collection method into a WildcardOutput
