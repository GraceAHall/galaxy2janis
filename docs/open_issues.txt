issue
    quast - missing 'r_fasta' parameter in workflow step
    find a better way to mark things as optional?
solution
    if a CommandComponent is not Optional and has default=None, but is not linked to a StepInput, can assume it is therefore Optional. 



ONGOING
issue
- duplicated tags being registered for individual tool
    quast:
    references_list1=w.quast_references_list1
    k_mer_stats1=""
    circos1/circos2
solution
- pulling command components from both param arguments and formatted cmdstrs resulted in occasional duplications
- due to bad practise galaxy XML: eg a select param representing a bool flag in the tool
- ongoing: 
    - quast references-list
    - fq11, fq12 - why are these registered more than once?
