currently might miss some variables. might not be the end of the world. 


TODO v0.1

- write logging for tools which can't currently be parsed (uses configfile etc)
    - types

- develop run program

- develop reporting program

- duplicate name resolving to LCA in gx_var path



Features

- Only using latest biocontainer version 

- logging for tools which can't currently be parsed
    - complex regex
    - types
    - uses configfile
    - needs user input (datatype / command line references) *


future:


- extract base command extras?
    - check for requirement with version token
    - if none, do an alignment between each requirement and tool id. pick requirement with best alignment score. 

- restructure command
    - (cutadapt) --minimum-length=$filter_options.minimum_length
    - (cutadapt) '-a', "'${a.adapter_source.adapter.fields.name}'='${a.adapter_source.adapter}${adapter_options.internal}'"

- more complex discover_datasets regex
    - currently anything between brackets gets removed
    - can't contain anything except [a-zA-Z0-9], -, _, *, .

- add support for configfiles -> write to file

- positional arguments

- parse tests





- auto parsing, test running and reporting

- write test suite

- supports common macros? is this done? 

- restructuredText processing to make helptext nicer
